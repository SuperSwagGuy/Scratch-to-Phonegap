         You've watched the movie. Now, you can play the game... on MOBILE DEVICES! From the creators of everything you like comes a very emotional (and funny) app about a boy and his dog. Based on Mega Owchies The Movie on YouTube, Justin adopts a dog only to have him taken by Dr. Dance Party (that was my character in the movie). Justin must travel through 5 worlds, each with its own lit soundtrack, to find man's best friend:

-Grasslands (Morning)
-Grasslands (Afternoon)
-Grasslands (Evening)
-ShopMart
-HeartBurn World / Dr. Dance Party's Evil Secret Lair

 The Mega Owchies Video Game has been modified for mobile use, including:

-Arrow buttons replace arrow keys
-All music is now Non-Copyright
-All music is 29 seconds or less
-All art has been converted to Bitmap
-No more World Records (Sorry)

Features:
-Play as Justin and run, jump, climb, and bounce your way to victory
-Cut scenes!!!
-A lit soundtrack, none of which is copyrighted (4 realz this time)
-5 worlds and 3 boss levels based on Mega Owchies The Movie
-Self Destruct Sequence!
